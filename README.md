| Operator                               | Operator/Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pre increment operator (++i)`         | `value of i is incremented before assigning it to the variable i`     |
| `Post increment operator (i++)`        | `value of i is incremented after assigning it to the variable i);`    |
| `Pre decrement operator (–i)`          | `value of i is decremented before assigning it to the variable i`     |
| `Post decrement operator (i–)`         | `value of i is decremented after assigning it to variable i`          |

Colons can be used to align columns.

| x        | y           |  x|y  |  x&y  |   x^y |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 0      | right-aligned | $1600 | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 | $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |  $1
